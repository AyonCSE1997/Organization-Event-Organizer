# Motivation

In Sust, there are many different type of organization for example cultural, career oriented, debate etc. These organizations arranged many events throughout the calender year. They need many students as volunteer for organizing the event. This is a platform for the enthusiastic peoples of SUST and its organization.

The main motive here is to bring people together and help each other.

With our website, any organization of this university can call upon people who are willing to work on that particular field. Also volunteers who want to help organizations on their field of interest can search for events that are being organized.

Our website can make the job easier for the organizations. They can create event in the website and recruit students as volunteer.
